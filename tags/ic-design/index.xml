      <description>Introduction The main goal of this application is the measurement result of rotating object, such as speed of bicycle wheel. The system should have ability to interpret measurement result to be international unit of speed, namely meters per second. To realize this system, we will attach a sensor device on the bicycle. And then, our design by using some logical operation, will update the output periodically or simultaneously to interpret measurement result using 4 until 6 binary number and have precision up to 1 m/s.</description>
